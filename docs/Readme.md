## Project Management Process Overview

OctoAcme's project management methodology is designed around transparency, iteration, and clear ownership. Our practices support:
- **Customer-first focus:** Prioritize outcomes that deliver the most value and usability for customers.
- **Iterative delivery:** Work is planned and shipped in small, testable increments. Feedback loops drive continuous improvement.
- **Defined roles:** See [Roles & Personas](./octoacme-roles-and-personas.md) for Project Manager, Product Manager, Developers, QA, and Stakeholders.
- **Structured lifecycle:** We progress through clear stages — Initiation, Planning, Execution, Release, and Retrospective.
- **Standard artifacts:** Every project maintains artifacts such as a Project Charter, Risk Register, Backlog, Release Plan, and Retrospective notes.
- **Team rhythm:** Weekly or twice-weekly syncs, stakeholder updates, and regular demos allow for transparency and agile decision making.
- **Best practices:** Data-driven decisions, psychological safety, acceptance criteria for all work, and a culture of learning and improvement.
